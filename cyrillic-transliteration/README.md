# Cyrillic transliteration ALA-LC (firefox 10+ fix)

Full-page Romanization of Cyrillic according to ALA-LC standards. Converts Cyrillic letters on web sites to Latin transliteration (fixed for firefox 10+)

Fixed version of [this script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/89930), since replaceWholeText was removed from firefox 10.

Additionally, I've removed the "`@include *`" - the user must enable it on individual pages using the greasemonkey preferences (or "`*`" if you don't mind having this script run on every page).
