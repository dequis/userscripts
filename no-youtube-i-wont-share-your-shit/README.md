# no youtube i won't share your shit

(UNMAINTAINED, READ DESCRIPTION). don't switch to the share panel after the video is over, letting you read the description

### NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE

I've been using [youtube feather beta](http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta) the last few months, which doesn't have a share panel at all.

It seems that the normal youtube view has this ajax mode enabled for all browsers, so this script probably won't work anymore.

You should use "[Youtube: Stop Auto-Switch to Share Panel](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/386470)" instead, which does the same as this script, and also seems to prevent switching to the share panel when you click like. (Thanks to eroock for suggesting it)

### original description follows.

seriously youtube we already know how to link to videos

**right now this only works reliably in firefox + greasemonkey.**

other userscript engines **may** have issues, currently working on getting them sorted. i have no idea how they manage to break an one line userscript like that.

changelog

* 1.0.0.1gamma0.0.0.1: complete rewrite thanks to my friend [chinatsu](http://userscripts.org/users/chinatsu), now it doesn't remove the share panel, only stops the share at end, and the code is much simpler
* 1.0.0.0beta0.1: tiny bugfix (it was restricted to urls that start with "/watch?v=", now it's just "/watch?")
* 1.0.0.0beta0: initial release
