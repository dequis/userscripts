# dxbooru: dx's random tweaks to boorus

dx's random tweaks to boorus: smaller header, smaller sidebar, bigger thumbnails on hover, mark clicked links with half opacity

![](http://i.imgur.com/zaXCtWF.gif)

* bigger thumbnails on hover(150%)
* mark clicked links with half opacity (replaces my other script)
* smaller header (danbooru only)
* smaller sidebar (some boorus)

supports out of the box:

* danbooru
* gelbooru
* sankaku
* behoimi (3dbooru)
* koanachan
* yande.re
* shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com (because i don't really know any other decent shimmie)

you can add additional boorus by using the greasemonkey "user scripts preferences" window

if the site you want to add is `safebooru.org`, write it as `\*://safebooru.org/*`

most sites will work - some highly customized ones might silently fail.
